MUXSRC1 = 1

Reasoning: 

A new 2:1 multiplexer is required to handle the inputs from the SRC1 dataout and the 7-bit sign-extended output. 
This multiplexer will then direct its output to the memory's dataIN. 
Depending on the control signal, the multiplexer will select its input as follows: if the control signal is set to 1, the 7-bit sign-extended output is chosen;
if the control signal is 0, the output from SRC1 dataout is selected.

2. Computer B runs the programs faster than Computer A by about 20%. The reason 
for this being that Computer B is more efficinet by having a lower CPI as the equation 
to find the performance is P = Clockrate/CPI. The numbers from this come out to be that Computer A 
can do 1.25 billion instructions per second compared to Computer B doing 1.5 billion instructions.

Execution Stage: 
IF: 0
ID : 1
Exec: 3
MEM: 5

Control Signals (Specified since its the last execuation stage and these matter the most):
WEpc = 1
MUXpc = 2

Reasoning: 

We need to connect a wire from the dataOut output of the memory to the MuxPC input. As a result of adding an additional input to the MUX, 
we must include an extra bit in the MUX's control logic to allow selection among three possible inputs. 
When the control signal for MuxPC is set to 2, the value from dataOut will be routed to the Program Counter (PC).
